							<p><strong>Undal (WYRD) Community Manifesto</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Declaration of Purpose</strong></p>
							<p>The Undal (WYRD) Network is built upon a core belief: Proof of Work (PoW) is the only true mechanism by which real value can be added to a cryptocurrency. It is through this decentralized, transparent process that trust, security, and genuine value are established. We, the community of Undal, stand firm in our commitment to PoW as the heart of our network, ensuring that it is the miners—those who contribute real computational effort—who sustain and grow the ecosystem.</p>	
							<p>We are not simply building another blockchain; we are creating a movement. A movement rooted in the lessons learned from Bitcoin's success, struggles, and evolution. Undal is a tribute to the values of transparency, decentralization, and empowerment, drawing from the best of the past while evolving to meet the needs of the future. We aim to deliver a decentralized financial network that functions without reliance on any one person, entity, or centralized authority.</p>
							<p><strong>The Power of PoW and Decentralization</strong></p>
							<p>At the core of Undal is the idea that miners control the network, adding value through honest work. Mining isn’t just a process of securing transactions; it is the foundation of everything. Every block mined on Undal’s network is a testament to the decentralized power that fuels the ecosystem. PoW ensures that no one entity can dominate the chain. Each miner, no matter how big or small, contributes to the integrity of the network.</p>
							<p>We are creating an environment where miners—whether solo operators with modest equipment or large-scale miners—can thrive. Undal welcomes older, once-considered irrelevant ASICs, and solo miners with low power costs, providing them with an opportunity to contribute and be rewarded in a meaningful way. Our hybrid Layer 1 and Layer 2 architecture will ensure that all miners have a role, enabling connections across chains while keeping our base layer decentralized and secure.</p>
							<p>Our ethos is simple: decentralize everything. Through a decentralized and distributed miner network, we prevent any single point of failure or dominance. Our network thrives on individual contributions, with each miner holding a piece of the future.</p>	
							<p><strong>Transparency and Positivity as Core Values</strong></p>
							<p>Transparency is not just an expectation—it is a non-negotiable standard within the Undal community. Every action, every decision, and every process within our ecosystem will be fully transparent and verifiable by anyone. From the genesis block to the daily operations, transparency builds trust, and trust is the currency of any true decentralized network.</p>
							<p>Equally important to us is positivity. Our community will reject FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) and embrace constructive conversations that help grow the network. Questions are always welcome, but disruptive negativity is not. We believe in lifting each other up, not tearing each other down.</p>							
							<p>We value clarity, collaboration, and care for one another within our network. We treat every community member as a vital part of the whole, and in doing so, we ensure that the network’s growth is inclusive, supportive, and geared toward success.</p>
							<p><strong>Mining for the Future: Founders of Undal</strong></p>
							<p>In the Undal community, every miner is a founder. To be a founder of Undal is not tied to an early buy-in, but rather to participation in the life force of the network: mining. By mining the chain and securing the network, you gain rewards in uBTC and build massive supply over time.</p>
							<p>We believe in mining with intent. Miners in Undal don’t just create blocks; they control the new supply, strategically managing their assets to maximize value. We embrace a long-term view—selling on pumps, holding during dips—and extracting maximum value (MEV) to ensure that miners are at the heart of the network’s growth and financial success.</p>
							<p>Our vision includes a future where miners drive the economy. As the network grows, miners who believed in the network early on will have the opportunity to see their rewards soar in value, creating new wealth for themselves and the wider community. This is our chance at a Bitcoin-like renaissance, a second opportunity to build value by participating in a truly decentralized network.</p>
							<p><strong>A Layered, Seamless Connection to the Future</strong></p>
							<p>Undal (WYRD) is not just another blockchain. We are building a Web3 Layer 1 and Layer 2 hybrid network that will seamlessly connect to all valuable chains. This means that while we remain rooted in the decentralized PoW tradition, we also embrace modern innovations to create a network that is faster, safer, and more scalable than traditional blockchains.</p>
							<p>By connecting to external chains via wrapped uBTC and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we will offer unprecedented liquidity and accessibility. Speculation on uBTC will be possible on nearly every major DEX, giving miners and investors alike the freedom to interact with the broader crypto economy. However, while speculation is part of the system, the heart of the Undal network will always remain in its PoW foundation—where real value is created, not just traded.</p>
							<p>Our goal is to make blockchain safer, faster, and cheaper while staying true to our decentralized roots. Undal is the first step toward that goal, providing an inclusive network that empowers miners, respects the values of transparency and positivity, and prioritizes long-term success for all.</p>
							<p><strong>A Future in Your Hands</strong></p>
							<p>Undal (WYRD) is for the people, by the people. Our mission is to deliver a decentralized, transparent, and community-driven financial network that stands resilient in the face of an uncertain future. As miners, as founders, and as community members, we hold the power to shape this network and guide it to new heights.</p>
							<p>The journey starts now. Mine, hold, and be part of the revolution. Together, we are building a new Bitcoin—a blockchain for the Web3 era—that belongs to all of us.</p>						
							<p><strong>Welcome to Undal.</strong></p>
